# stringy (C# .Net 9.0)

- Will convert a string of comma-separated values to a bulleted list with an option 
to sort each section of the list in it's own alphabetical order
-  Parentheses determine the depth of the bullet point
## NOTES: 
1) Might be overkill for a simple task, but I created a small class and built a structure of the List with depth
 and children to allow for future expansion if needed.
2) If I could have talked with the designer/requester, I might have made some different choices. For now,
I leaned towards readability and maintainability over performance.
